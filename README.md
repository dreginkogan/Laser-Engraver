# Laser-Engraver
CNC Laser engraver capable of using Arduino Uno and GRBL

I have only posted the CAD model, which can be used to get any necessary .stl files for 3d printing. You can also use it to get a general idea of how to assemble the engraver.

Here is a list of non-3D printed parts that you may need:


	Extrusions:
	
		4x 150mm x 20mm x 20mm aluminum t-slot extrusions
		4x 350mm x 20mm x 20mm aluminum t-slot extrusions
		3x 500mm x 20mm x 20mm aluminum t-slot extrusions
		
	Belt System:
	
		12x perlin wheels for t-slot aluminum extrusion
		1x 5M GT2 Timing bekt
		2x 20 teeth 5mm bore belt pulleys
		2x idler pulleys
