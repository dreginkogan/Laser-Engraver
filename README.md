please ignore how messy my room is


I have only uploaded the CAD model, which can be used to get any necessary .stl files for 3d printing. You can also use it to get a general idea of how to assemble the engraver.


It WAS able to get it toengrave, though all the software I had to use was too complicated and annoying to use.

Also, this project ended, and the parts that I used to build it have been reporposed into a catapult, which I will eventually put on github.
